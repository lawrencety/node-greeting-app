>  What is a Node module?

A: A module is a collection of methods similar to a JS library. It is typically grouped by functionality so it is decoupled from the application. This helps reusability and maintenance.

>  What is the main difference between `exports` and `module.exports`?

A: `exports` is a reference to `module.exports`. `module.exports` can be reassigned while `exports` cannot.

>  Why is using exports recommended?

A: It is recommended because exports will not be reassigned in the event of human error.

####Programming Questions

>  Before you begin, make sure you have greeting.js and main.js in the following states:

`greeting.js`
```
    exports.greetingEnglish = function(){
     console.log("Hello");
    }

    exports.greetingJapanese = function(){
     console.log("Konichiwa");
    }
```

`main.js`
```
    const greetings = require("./greeting.js");

    // "Hello"
    greetings.greetingEnglish();

    // "Konichiwa"
    greetings.greetingJapanese();
```

>  Add two more functions, greetingSpanish and greetingIcelandic, in greeting.js.
>  Utilize the two functions in main.js just like greetingEnglish and greetingJapanese.
>  Create another Node module and import it into main.js. Your Node module should have at least two functions within it. Then, call a function from your Node module in main.js.
